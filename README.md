UAlive is the next evolution of Bolt Extensions. We are starting to roll out the first alpha process, of including a Live Inheritance based structure and all C# constructs for Bolt. Generate C# Live scripts to code any type live on the fly. Generate C# native scripts to share and get all of the beauty of speed and AOT safety. Our generated scripts do not rely on UAlive or Bolt being in the project.
<br/><br/>
***Note: UAlive is not currently stable enough for production. We are working through testing all possible edge cases, and adding necessary features. Once we are close enough to release, should you wait for a production ready product. Graphs could go wonky, Units could miss information, but we hope to make it as smooth as possible***
