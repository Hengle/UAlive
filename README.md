UAlive is the next evolution of Bolt Extensions. We are starting to roll out the first alpha process, of including a Live Inheritance based structure and all C# constructs for Bolt. Generate C# Live scripts to code any type live on the fly. Generate C# native scripts to share and get all of the beauty of speed and AOT safety. Our generated scripts do not rely on UAlive or Bolt being in the project.
